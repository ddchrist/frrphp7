Here is a brief explanation on the process to send me (Thales) IRFs using the girafe tool.<br>
Using the girafe tool (http://10.17.43.200 on the administrative network, or the IRF icon on the small screen of CWPs of the TTF):<br>
-          Create an IRF with required information.<br>
-          Set Status to <b>ToThales</b> <u>and</u> Responsible to <b>TATM</b><br>
-          Send me an email to notify me that there is a new IRF to analyze.<br>
Once the analysis is done, and the IRF is agreed to be closed (following a de-briefing)<br>
I will update the Girafe database with the answer to the IRF, the PCR number if there is one, and change the Status to <b>FromThales</b> and the owner back to <b>NAV</b>.<br>
Please note that once an IRF has been set to <b>ToThales</b> and <b>TATM</b>, all the new changes made by NAVIAIR to the IRF inside the girafe tool will be discarded until I set it back to <b>FromThales NAV</b> (send an email instead to add inputs to the IRF).<br>
